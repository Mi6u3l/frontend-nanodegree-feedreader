#Test Driven Development

#Project Overview

In this project I've written a set of test to validate a web-based application that reads RSS feeds.
I have used [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/) as a library for unit tests.

# Tests that I have wrote

1. Ensures that each feed on the allFeeds object has a URL defined and that the URL is not empty.
2. Ensures that each feed on the allFeeds object has a Name defined and that the Name is not empty.
3. Ensures that the menu element is hidden by default.
4. Ensures that the menu changes visibility when the menu icon is clicked. 
5. Ensures that the loadFeed function is called and completes its work.
6. Ensures that when a new feed is loaded by the loadFeed function the content actually changes.

# Run the application
